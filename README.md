# Deep-Vision-Face-Recognition-System
It’s an end-to-end face recognition system where a CNN generates face embeddings, served via FastAPI. The frontend captures images, backend performs inference, compares embeddings stored in a database, and returns verification results. The system is cloud-deployed and designed for scalability.
